# I-CookPad
In Cookpad, we successfully implemented Firebase Storage and Realtime Database. Images of recipes and categories are stored securely with Storage, while RTBBDD manages user and recipe data in real time, enabling instant updates and user collaboration. This enhances the user experience by providing a dynamic platform for sharing culinary knowledge.
